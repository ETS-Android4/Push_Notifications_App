Push notifications are short messages that pop up on the userâ€™s mobile or desktop, nudging them to take some action. In short, push notifications are alerts that are "pushed" to your devices by apps, even when those apps aren't open. They're designed to catch your attention on smartphones, laptops and desktops. This project is the design of an app that sends push notifications to an android device depending on the customer's position in a store. I use OneSignal API for push notifications and also, i use RabbitMQ for receiving critical events with data from a MySQL database. Finally, the user has the ability to decide when he wants to receive a notification, making a subscription to the categories for which he is interested for.
